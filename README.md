# QUOTES-
**PROJECT LINK:** https://ray-b-ouamba.github.io/QUOTES-GENERATOR-WEBSITE

## HOW IT'S MADE:
## TECH USED:
* HTML
* CSS
* JaAVASCRIPT

## OPTIMIZATIONS
* We could have included more sharing buttons (e.g., Facebook, Pinterest) instead of just one (Twitter).
* When the quote is shared, there are no quotation marks, so we may add them.

## LESSONS LEARNED:
* How to display the content from the API on a website using Javascript.
* How to share content from your website to an another website.
